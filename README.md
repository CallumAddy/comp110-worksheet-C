a) State what task this algorithm performs.

1) procedure HASDUPLICATE(list)

a) This line starts the function called "HasDuplicate(list)" and adds the variable list in the parameters

2) let n be the length of list

a) This makes "n" the length of the list that will be assigned.

3) for i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1 do

a) this sets a loop for when i equals 0 up to the value of n - 1, and it'll do something until it reaches that value

4) for j = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1 do

a) this sets a loop for when j equals 0 up to the value of n - 1, and it'll do something until it reaches that value

5) if i (does not equals sign) j and list[i] = list[j] then

a) if i does not equals j and the list i is the same as list j then it'll continue with the program

6) return true

a) this will return true if the if statement is true

7) end if

a) this ends the if statement

8) end for

a) this ends the first for loop

9) end for

a) this ends the second for loop

10) return false

a) if the if statement isn't true it'll return false by default

11) end procedure

a) this ends the function
